# lab1

Because I have a windows machine I could no run the .sh file the way the lab specified and was told to justy
copy my commands. I did that and included a full copy/paste of the powershell I ran them in. However,
I made few mistakes and ran a few additional commands so the output may not be in the exact order
as the lab specified. I apologize but it took a while to run and could not get the lab in the 
exact order as there were a few commands that were slightly different on my machine. I think
I eventually got all the commands to work as desired and the responses.txt file is included
as well.
