The docker run ubuntu command started a real docker image and takes
us inside the ubuntu container with the displayed container ID. \

At first we see that no docker container is running with the ps command.
Then we run the ubuntu container and check again with the ps command
and we can see that there is an active container and we can see what the
ID is. \

It appears that the command shut down the specified docker container. \

Initially it did look like my userid was running. I checkd using the
docker ps command to see what was running and it looked liked several
were running. I must not have shut them all down because I had some
trouble installing with windows and may have forgotten to shut them
down. But after running docker rm @(docker ps -aq) it seemed to remove 
all the running ones and I was able to start one using the correct
userid on my machine. \

The ubuntu container with my id was started and then we updated from within
the docker container. \

I learned that we can install things such as vim from within the docker ubuntu
container via apt-get and navigate through directories as we would in a command
prompt. \

This command command returns a live data stream for running containers. 
And the flags limited the data to specific containers in this case the no
stream restriction which appears to be the ones with active memory. \ 

docker stops followed by the specified docker container and
ubuntu (or whatever you're running) shuts down that docker conatiner specifically.
Meaning you cannot access it from the command prompt. \

The docker kill subcommand kills one or more containers. The main process inside 
the container is sent signal and it can be specified with the user id. \

This command ran the docker container and started a directory inside of it
and the -v command stands for mount volumes or current directories. \

My container was not running. Perhaps because I shut it down differnntly but
that is working correctly by the rules of the cp command. I will just start it
again. \

I see nothing but perhaps because there is no clab1.txt file. the vi command opened it
inside the docker command so maybe I need to create it here? \

I see the ubuntu container has been added. \

It appears weave just added another docker ubuntu containers that has the tag update
and committed it so that it to docker images. \

This information is a json of all the inforation about the updated ubuntu conatiner
that we added in the last line. It has it's id, tags, repo metadata, and some other 
informaiton about this object. \
